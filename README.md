# ArduinoProjects
My personal experiments with an Arduino Uno. Please refer to the GettinStarted page to learn more how to get started with an
Arduino and to possibly follow along with some of my experiments.

The experiments that I will be doing will initially be simple, but they will progressively get more complex. The experiments will be in folders to categorize their complexity.

Circuits will be designed with https://www.circuit-diagram.org/ and https://www.circuitlab.com/ (for smaller circuits).
