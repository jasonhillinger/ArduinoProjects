This experiment was to successfully connect two switches to the Arduino that will control the direction of a stepper motor.
Since this experiment will be considered intermediate, it will require a little more preparation than the other experiments
found in the SimpleExperiments folder. After collecting the materials for the experiment, connect the circuits as done in
switchCircuits.png and mainCircuit.png

//MATERIALS//
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+ Arduino
+ Arduino USB cable
+ 3.3V/5V control board
+ 9V Battery holder with barrel jack plug
+ 9v Battery
+ Breadboard
+ 28BYJ-48 5V Step motor
+ Motor driver (specifically for the 28BYJ-48)
+ Push button switches x2
+ Various amounts of wires (As many as you want)


//PROCEDURE//
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1:
Attach the 3.3V/5V control board to the Breadboard with its inbuilt pins, with the + and - pins in their respective
breadboard pins. Ground the control board by connecting the - pin to the GND pin found on the Arduino.

Step 2:
Connect the motor driver - pin to the ground, and the + pin to the same positive pin that the 3.3V/5V control board is
connected to. The pins IN1, IN2, IN3, IN4 on the motor driver must be connected to the Arduino pins 8, 9, 10, 11 respectively.

Step 3:
Connect the 28BYJ-48 to the motor driver. There is only one fashion to plugging this in and is fail proof, so you cant make
the mistake of connecting it improperly.

Step 4:
Connect two push buttons like so in the circuit design provided as so.

Step 5:
Connect the 9V battery to its battery holder, then connect the barrel jack plug into the 3.3V/5V control board. Be sure to
also connect the Arduino to the computer.

Step 6:
Upload the code provided in stepperMotorController.ino

--Operating the circuit--

Step 7:
Press the power switch on the 3.3V/5V control board to turn on the motor, a green light should appear when done so.
Press one of the switches and observe results.

//RESULTS//
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The step motor will preform a 180 degree rotation once a button is pushed. Once the rotation is complete, another button
press could be done to do another rotation. Direction of the rotation is dependent on the button.
