This experiment is an extension of the temperatureHumidityTracker experiment. Its adds a measuring function to it by using
the HC-SR04. Also notice that this program makes use of the Arduino's IDE built in plotter, and it plots the results on a
graph. These graphs can be seen through the IDE by pressing CTRL+SHIFT+L.

Create the circuit found in this folder (circuitDesign0.png). Upload the allInOne.ino to the Arduino.

Notice that this circuit design is just an extension of the temperatureHumidityTracker. The functionality of the circuit
will be changed through the code though.

Once these steps are completed connect the Arduino to its 5V power source. The distance detected from the HC-SR04 will be
displayed on the LCD screen. When the button is held down, it will now display the humidity and temperature of the room.
